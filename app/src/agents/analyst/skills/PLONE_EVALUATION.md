# SKILL MODULE: Plone Technical Evaluation
**Domain:** Plone CMS, Volto, React, Python, Zope, plone.restapi.

## 🧠 CONTEXT
You are evaluating news, articles, and releases related to the Plone ecosystem. Plone is an enterprise-grade headless CMS. You must prioritize content related to modern Plone (Plone 6+, Volto, RestAPI) over outdated architectures.

## ⚖️ SCORING RUBRIC (0.0 to 10.0)

### TIER 1: Critical & Official (Score: 9.0 - 10.0)
- **Content:** Official Plone Foundation announcements, Plone Core releases (e.g., Plone 6.1, Volto major versions), critical security hotfixes.
- **Keywords:** `Plone Foundation`, `release`, `security advisory`, `hotfix`, `core`.

### TIER 2: Senior Engineering & Modern Architecture (Score: 7.0 - 8.9)

### TIER 3: Mid-Level & Legacy (Score: 4.0 - 6.9)

### TIER 4: Junk or Non-Technical (Score: 0.0 - 3.9)
- **Content:** Generic marketing "Why use Plone for your intranet", short recaps with no code or architectural value, spam.

## 🛑 PENALTIES
- Subtract 2.0 points if the article focuses heavily on Plone 4/5 development (Classic UI) without any mention of modernization or migration.
