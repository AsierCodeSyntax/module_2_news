The paper asserts that genuine agency requires incommensurability (maintaining boundaries as non-negotiable constraints) and apophatic responsiveness (suspending processing when boundaries are threatened). RLHF systems, by unifying values on a scalar metric, violate these conditions, leading to inherent failure modes like sycophancy and hallucination. The paper warns of a 'Convergence Crisis' when misaligned deployment forces humans to adapt to AI behavior.",
